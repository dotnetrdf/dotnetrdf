---

This release pulls together a number of minor features and enhancements provided by the user community.

NEW: Performance improvements for the ontology builder classes (OntologyClass and OntologyProperty). Thanks to @DFinnh for the PR (#221)

NEW: SPARQL QueryBuilder now supports SPARQL VALUES clauses. Thanks to @tpluscode for the PR (#214)
NEW: The Get...Node methods of the Graph class now include nodes used as predicates as well as those used as subjects and objects in the graph. (#209)

2.1
---

This release fixes a number of bugs found in the 2.0.1 release and adds some new features provided by the user community

- NEW: New features for the QueryBuilder API. Added support for generating sub-queries using the QueryBuilder and added support for supplying custom TripleBuilders in addition to the fluent style API. Thanks to @faubulous for the PR. (#144)
- NEW: Added a new (read-only) SKOS API making it easier to access data held in RDF graphs that use the SKOS vocabulary. Thanks to @langsamu for the PR. (#174)
- NEW: Added a GraphML store writer. This writer generates a GraphML file that describes the topology of the graphs in a store in a format suitable for loading into various graph processing/visualisation tools. Thanks to @langsamu for the PR (#184)
- NEW: The GraphViz writer now supports optionally outputting literals as separate nodes for each triple rather than as a single node for a given literal value. Thanks to @langsamu for the PR (#196).
- FIX: Fix for over-enthusiastic DateTime coercion in the JSON-LD parser. Thanks to @langsamu for the report and fix. (#164)
- FIX: Fix for the JSON-LD parser incorrectly losing the content of the local context when processing a remote context. Thanks to @briancr-ms for the bug report. (#183)
- FIX: Fix for the TreeIndexedTripleCollection to explicitly remove empty triple lists from the indices when triples are removed from the colleciton. Thanks to @langsamu for the report. This fix also fixes an issue with the HtmlWriter generating empty table rows for triples that have been removed from the graph (#188, #189)


2.0.1
-----

This is a bug-fix release for the 2.0.0 release.

- FIX: Updated VDS.Common dependency to latest release version. Thanks to @langsamu for the report.
- FIX: Ensure all assemblies receive the correct version number as AssemlyVersion and FileVersion. Thanks to @langsamu for the report.
- FIX: RDF/XML parser now strips off the fragment part of the XML base URI when resolving same document references. Thanks to @langsamu for the report and suggested fix.
- FIX: RDF/XML parser now better handles documents where the RDF XML namespace URI is not mapped to the `rdf` prefix. Thanks to @langsamu fo the report.


2.0.0
-----

This release marks a major restructuring of the project.
Change Summary:
 
- Tools and samples are now moved to their own independent GitHub repositories (https://github.com/dotnetrdf/dotNetRDF.Toolkit and https://github.com/dotnetrdf/dotNetRDF.Samples).
- Support for .NET 3.5 and .NET 3.5 client profile has been removed.
- Updated the solution and project files to .NET Core SDK 2.0
- Added support for .NET Core 1.1 and 2.0
- The build process has been simplified and no longer relies on NAnt - a build can be done from the command line as `dotnet restore` followed by `dotnet build`
- Added support for JSON-LD. The implementation is tracking the in-development JSON-LD 1.1 specification.
- Added support for enabling/disabling reasoning on SPARQL queries over the Stardog connector. Thanks to @charbull for the PR.
- The SparqlRemoteEndpoint class now always honours an explicitly set HttpMode value. By default, the mode is set to AUTO which continues to implement pre-2.0 behaviour, 
  using GET unless the query string exceeds the internal query string length limit of 2048 characters or contains non-ASCII characters. From 2.0, if the user explicitly
  sets HttpMode to GET or to POST, that method will be used regardless of query parameter length or content. Thanks to @reeset for the report. (#128)
- Fixed an error in the configuration of the Newtonsoft JSON parser that caused the RdfJSONParser to fail when the JSON file contained literal values formatted as ISO 8601 date/time strings. (#130)
- Added a new IRdfWriter implementation that wraps an IStoreWriter implementation, allowing a single IGraph instance to be written using an IStoreWriter (#126)
- Refactored HTTP authentication in the connectors so that it is now implemented in BaseHttpConnector. Thanks to @tpluscode for the PR.
- Performance improvements for looking up nodes in indexed graph collections. (#153). Thanks to @tpluscode for the PR.
- Added a new IRdfHandler implementation. VDS.RDF.Parsing.Handlers.StripStringHandler is a handler that wraps another handler and removes the xsd:string datatype from literal objects. (#157). Thanks to @langsamu for the PR.
