Store Manager Plugins
=====================

Store Manager now allows you to plugin new Triple Stores very easily with minimal coding effort and without
any need for you to edit Store Manager's codebase yourself.

To do this you will need to implement the following interfaces in your own assembly:

IStorageProvider
- Can be found under VDS.RDF.Storage in dotNetRDF.dll
- This is the interface which actually provides the connectivity between dotNetRDF and a Triple Store

IConnectionDefinition
- Can be found under VDS.RDF.Utilities.StoreManager.Connections in StoreManager.Core.dll
- This interface is used to specify available connection settings and instantiate connections
- Essentially is just a class that implements the interface and annotates its properties
  with the ConnectionAttribute
  
Then simply drop your assembly as a DLL into this folder, restart Store Manager or go to Help > About and
hit the rescan button and it will automatically detect the available Triple Stores from your assembly.
