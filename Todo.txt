dotNetRDF To Do
===============

This is a summary of the various TODOs currently in the source organised by project.

We use the following grades of To Dos:

REQ - This task is a requirement for the next release.  Often used when stub classes are added for
	  new features but not yet implemented or for important changes/improvements to existing features.
	  
HACK - The code near this TODO is a temporary work around typically for a bug/issue in 3rd party code/system
	   that our code interacts with and should be changed at some point subject to the resolution of the issue.
	   
BUG - This task denotes a bug that needs to be fix for which we don't yet have a fix/time to fix.
	  
TODO - This task should be done for the next release (time-permitting).  Typically used for nice
	   improvements that should be done at some point or used while working on new features to
	   indicate unfinished sections
	   
Q - This task may be necessary subject to the determination of the answer to the question in the To Do.

OPT - This task is optional (time-permitting) and is typically non-essential.

SLV - This task is related to porting to Silverlight

PORT - This task is related to porting 3rd party code onto the dotNetRDF API

2x REQ: Implement OPTIONS for SPARQL Uniform HTTP Protocol
HACK: Changed to an accept all for the time being to ensure works OK with DBPedia and Virtuoso
HACK: Have to send only RDF/XML as the accept header due to a known issue with Talis Platform
TODO: Implement IsIpvFuture
TODO: Add support for reading Base Uri from xml:base attributes in the file
TODO: Implement type compatability detection for numeric types
2 x Q: Do we need a more general fix for null Base URI here?
Q: Does LOAD into a named Graph require that Graph to be pre-existing?
Q: Do we need to do something special to check whether there are any sets with this variable also unbound in the other set and thus eliminate/keep it?
Q: Assert that this resource is a Class?
Q: Assert that this resource is a property?
Q: What should the behaviour be when the payload is null for a POST? Assuming a 200 OK response
OPT: Replace with usage of MapTriple instead?
OPT: Extract these constants into a Notation3SpecsHelper class
OPT: Add Some more validation of Uri References here?
OPT: Could ensure that the parameter name actually appears in the query?
OPT: Add support to the SPARQL Update Parser for selectable syntax in the future
OPT: Do this multi-threaded?
OPT: Move the following into TurtleSpecsHelper?
2 x OPT: Do we need to process the charset parameter here at all?
SLV: Implement a version of the UriLoader that makes the requests asynchronously?
