        <p><a href="https://github.com/w3c/rdf-star/issues/31">Submitted Use Case</a></p>
        <p>
          As a materials scientist working with ontologies.  I want to enrich
          relationships between objects. For example "A --similar--&gt; B"
          with a similarity measure of 0.5, So that I can identify the pairs of objects with relationships of certain
          "strength". Visualization of the edges with accordingly weighted thickness would be a huge
          plus.

        <h4>distinguish interpretation from representation</h4>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/w3c/rdf-star/issues/32">Submitted Use Case</a></p>
        <p>
          As a data service,<br/>
          from an architectural perspective, interpretation should be
          distinct from and cleanly layered over representation - both abstract and
          concrete, in order to facilitate implementation and assure the ability to
          support future use cases as knowledge evolves over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this perspective, the standard treatment of blank node labels is an
          anti-requirement, the lessons of which should dissuade from unnecessarily
          restrictive relations between interpretation and representation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The situation with blank node labels is a case where the interpretation was
          fixed, to treat them as referentially opaque. that was a mistake. it would have
          been better to separate the interpretation from the representation and to allow
          alternatives.

        <h4>Natural representation of PG data in RDF</h4>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/w3c/rdf-star/issues/33">Submitted Use Case</a></p>
        <p>
          As a KG vendor, we want Stardog customers to have easy to use means to attach
          properties to edges in their RDF graph or load property graph data with edge
          properties. Here "easy" specifically means that neither the customer nor the
          database should have to wreck the data model (and queries) to use any of the
          workarounds available in plain RDF for that purpose (like the RDF
          reification). For example, if the customer has 
        </p>
        <pre>:pavel :worksAt :Stardog</pre>
        <p>edge in
          the data and wants to add ... <tt>:since 2011</tt> to it, neither they nor the database
          should have to transform it into a bunch of different triples like 
        </p>
        <pre>
          []
            rdf:subject :pavel ; 
            rdf:property :worksAt ... 
        </pre>
        <p>
          (and then also rewrite queries
          so that <tt>?s :worksAt :Stardog</tt> still returns <tt>:pavel</tt>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Also we want to enable customers to store that annotated statement in any named
          graph they want so we don't want to use named graphs for representing statement-level
          metadata.
        </p>

        <h4>Meta-properties over properties</h4>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/w3c/rdf-star/issues/35">Submitted Use Case</a></p>
        <p>
          As a data engineer,<br/>
          I want to add meta-properties over properties, from an existing SQL-DB to a Graph-DB; that is for example
          for a node of type PERSON, with a property :birthDate='1985-01-20', I want to be able to say
          the property was created on '2020-11-10', by a user 'editor1' with the role 'writer'.
        </p>
        <p>
          So that I do not need to transform the property into a relation plus yet another node.

        <p>
          As a member of the Wikidata community,<br/>
          I would like to see triple stores
          supporting the Wikidata/Wikibase data model as much as possible, so that
          provenance information etc. can be represented in a way which is pleasing to the
          mind and software-systems such as Wikibase.

        <h4>UniProt: attributed/evidenced triples</h4>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/w3c/rdf-star/issues/47">Submitted Use Case</a></p>
        <p>
          As an UniProt developer,<br/>
          I want an easier way to talk about triples we have
          asserted. So that querying and parsing data-models from evidenced triples
          becomes simpler.
          </p>
        <pre>
&lt;P26948&gt; up:annotation &lt;P26948#SIPDB6A831D8E2E2D2A&gt; .
&lt;#_kb.P26948_up.annotation_A144DC8D56EA0928&gt; rdf:type rdf:Statement ;
  rdf:subject &lt;P26948&gt; ;
  rdf:predicate up:annotation ;
  rdf:object &lt;P26948#SIPDB6A831D8E2E2D2A&gt; ;
  up:attribution &lt;P26948#attribution-89AC1B682EEB440D50C4AEBB24FCA860&gt; .
        </pre>
        <p>
          is a lot of bytes to type, and even worse the five joins 
          are very expensive to perform.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our use-case for RDFstar etc. is to allow us to talk about triples as we do now,
          but with a higher performance and lower barrier to entry.
        </p>
        <p>
          We currently depend on the RDF/XML rdf:ID to easily parse this in our inhouse
          custom RDF parsers, and would like to keep this option open.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time we deal with a lot of renaming (IRIs) for the same thing.
          e.g. a related database might use http://identifiers.org/uniprot/P05067 instead
          of http://purl.uniprot.org/uniprot/P05067. And a owl:sameAs is used to merge
          these datasets. Our attributions/evidences should be found no matter which IRI
          is used.

        <p>
          As an ontologist/schema developer using SHACL<br/>
          I want to specify sh:message and sh:severity for individual constraints,
          e.g. attach to individual sh:minCount 1 triples because otherwise I would have
          to create an individual shape (subject) just for this information.

        <p>
          As a data engineer<br/>
          I want to attribute nodes in relations with additional
          detail so that details on the nodes is kept seperate from the property.  E.g.:
          two persons meet at a certain time (which is an attribute of the relation) and
          one of them has a Covid-19 infection.

        <p>
          As an analyst</br>
          I want to represent competing scenarios
          so that I can compare predispositions and possible outcomes.
          As a dispatcher in an unfolding catastrophic event
          I want to integrate new information into a developing model of the event
          so that everybody can understand the dynamics and probable developments.
          Both scenarios can benefit from referential transparency but also faithful reproduction of source
          information.

        <p>
          As a knowledge worker<br/>
          I want to annotate statements from other named graphs and datasets where I might not even have write access
          so that I can make statements about statements on the web of data like about any other entity.

        <p><a href="https://github.com/w3c/rdf-star/issues/29#issuecomment-728334375">Submitted Use Case</a></p>
        <p>
          I want to annotate commit deltas to an RDF graph, e.g.:
          </p>
        <pre>
r:47e1cf2 a :Commit ; 
     :delete &lt;&lt;:bob :age 23&gt;&gt; ;
     :add &lt;&lt;:bob :age 24&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;:bob :gender :male&gt;&gt; .
</pre>
        <p>
          so that a triple can be searched for across commit history in SPARQL-star.
        </p>

      <section id="rdfsSupport">
        <h4>SPARQL-star/RDF-star and RDFS support</h4>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/w3c/rdf-star/issues/80#issuecomment-777292682">Submitted Use Case</a></p>
        <p>
          As a user, I want to express facts as triple statements `{:s :p :o}` within a
          triplestore.  Later on I realise I want to add facts about this fact.  However
          the {:s :p :o} triple has already been asserted in the triplestore, so I need to
          add a reification.
        </p>
        <pre>
          :key rdf:subject :s ; rdf:predicate :p ; rdf:object :o .
        </pre>
        <p>
          Now I can add facts about the fact:
        </p>
        <pre>
          :key :uom :cm ; :accuracy ".32" .
        </pre>
        <p>
          So far 'standard' reification.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, as a user I want to add some RDFS 'referential' integrity to help
          manage the use of additional predicates such a :uom and :accuracy.  Since the
          rdfs:domain of rdf:subject, rdf:predicate, and rdf:object, it can be inferred
          that :key is a rdf:Statement.  This then implies that the rdfs:domain of :uom
          and :accuracy is also rdf:Statement. Thus if I continue reifying other
          statements, any predicates associated with the reified statement must have a
          rdfs:domain of rdf:Statement.
        </p>
        <p>
          So as a user who wants to add some RDFS-based control over the model, I would
          introduce a rdfs:subClassOf so that predicates associated with this subClass
          have a rdfs:domain of this subclass
        </p>
        <p>
          Triple:
        </p>
        <pre>
          :Peter :married :Beth
          </pre>
        <p>
        Reified Triple:
        </p>
        <pre>
        :marriageKey rdf:subject :Peter ; rdf:predicate :married ; rdf:object :Beth .

        :marriageKey a :Marriage ;
                :when "1980" ;
    		        :where "Kelby" .
        </pre>
        <p>
          with the following RDFS assertions:
        </p>
        <pre>
          :Marriage rdfs:subClassOf rdf:Statement .
        </pre>
and
        <pre>
        :when rdfs:domain  :Marriage .
        :where rdfs:domain  :Marriage .
        </pre>
        <p>
          The benefits are that I can combine triple reification with RDFS providing the
          same benefits that rdfs offers to rdfs:Class to rdf:Statement.

        <h4>Time-sensitive data use case</h4>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/w3c/rdf-star/issues/120">Submitted Use Case</a></p>
        <p>
          As a Big Data and & AI platform-product owner<br/> 
          I want the capacity to describe and query relations in the graph with the
          dimension of temporal entity-events.
        </p><p>
          So that we could extract more power from the Graph, using relationships over
          time in stuff like job-assignment, seasonal events, and so on. In a website with
          a lot of annotated entities in each page and with the users navigating in that
          contents over time, we could also look into the user and its semantics data over
          time too.
        </p><p>
          So we could ask the RDF-star this kind of quotes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>"What is the semantic classes or entities for the user X with more consumption in the last 7 days"</li>
          <li>"What is the last job for the user X?"</li>
          <li>"What is the last edition of the program Y"</li>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/w3c/rdf-star/issues/132">Submitted Use Case</a></p>
        <p>As a Ph.D. student working on uncertainty,<br/>
          I want to use RDF* to represent uncertainty values for RDF statements, using the mUnc ontology.
          This offers the possibility to evaluate the reliability of statements in a specific
          context.
        </p>
        <p>
          See <a href="https://ns.inria.fr/munc/">mUnc (Metadata with UNCertainty) OWL
            ontology </a>for describing uncertainty information.

        <h4>Compact Serialization of OWL Graphs</h4>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/w3c/rdf-star/issues/148">Submitted Use Case</a></p>
        <p>
          As an OWL ontology provider who is responsible for providing multiple large
          biomedical ontologies, many including rich graph structures (partonomies,
          lineage hierarchies),
        </p>
        <p>
          I want a compact OWL serialization that avoids generating 4 triples for each
          existential axiom, whilst retaining semantic rigor.
        </p>
        <p>
          So that users of my ontologies can naturally traverse ontology graphs using
          simple triples, and optionally look up the OWL semantics of each triple.
        </p>
        <p>
          This use case is outlined in more detail in my blog post: 
          <a href="https://douroucouli.wordpress.com/2019/07/11/proposed-strategy-for-semantics-in-rdf-and-property-graphs"/
             >Proposed strategy for semantics in RDF* and Property Graphs</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The core idea is that instead of 4 triples for a TBox graph edge, as we have
          now:
        </p>
<pre>Finger owl:subClassOf [
  a owl:Restriction ;
  owl:onProperty :part_of owl:someValuesFrom :Hand
]
</pre>
        <p>
          we would have a triple linking finger to hand, with the OWL semantics of the
          triple specified as triples on the core triple:
        </p>
<pre>

          Note I have phrased this use case as a provider of biomedical ontologies (I
          provide some of the major ones, including GO, Uberon, Mondo, and am part of the
          Open Bio Ontologies team), but I believe this would be broadly useful. In
          particular I think this would be useful in Wikidata, which already provides
          existential axioms as simple triples.

        <p>I want to be able to annotate triples that are not in the graph</p>
        <p>As an web user, I want to be able to annotate any triples,
          regardless of whether they are in the same graph or not. Then I can annotate
          triples in a graph elsewhere on the web.

        <h3>Annotations of triples where the triples are in another graph of the same RDF Dataset</h3>
        <p class="contributor">Andy Seaborne</p>
        <p>
          As an information engineer, I want to be able to manage annotation triples
          separately from the data triples themselves. I wish to have a separategraph in
          the same RDF dataset.
          This will make data management more convenient - e.g. publishing without
          annotations; e.g. querying the data without the annotations visible.

        <p>I want to use an RDF-star triple to capture something like, 
          e.g., "the graph denoted by IRI ex:mygraph contains the edge/triple (ex:Bob, foaf:knows, ex:Alice)."</p>
