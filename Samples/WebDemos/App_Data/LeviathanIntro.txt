This is a demonstration of the <a href="../../content.asp?pageID=Leviathan">Leviathan</a> SPARQL Engine which the SPARQL Engine used in dotNetRDF.
</p>
<p>
The Leviathan engine supports all of SPARQL 1.0 and most of SPARQL 1.1 plus a wide variety of extension functions which includes the following:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../content.asp?pageID=XPath%20Function%20Library">XPath Function Library</a> - many string and numeric XPath functions are supported as well as some basic date time functions</li>
<li>ARQ Function Library - all of the ARQ functions (The Jena framework's SPARQL engine) are supported</li>
<li><a href="../../content.asp?pageID=Leviathan%20Function%20Library">Leviathan Function Library</a> - an extensive library of mostly numeric functions and some useful extension aggregates</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This demonstration endpoint may often be running a development build of dotNetRDF so capabilities and behaviour may differ from the public release versions.  To check this please examine the HTTP Headers on this page and you will see a custom <strong>X-dotNetRDF-Version</strong> Header detailing the deployed version.

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> This Demo has an initial data set which is a very small graph (58 triples) which we use for testing and debugging.  You can specify Graphs to query with by either using FROM and FROM NAMED clauses or by entering a URI in the Default Graph Uri box.  Loading Graphs may take a couple of seconds for the first query after which they will be temporarily cached for appoximately 15 minutes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Default Graph:</strong> Unless explicitly specified using FROM clauses in the Query or the Default Graph URI field the Default Graph is the union of all Graphs in the Dataset
