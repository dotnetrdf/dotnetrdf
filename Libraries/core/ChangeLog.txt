  - Added support for MINUS patterns
  - Added support for SERVICE patterns
  - Added support for BINDINGS clause
  - FederatedSparqlRemoteEndpoint class for federated querying
  - ISparqlQueryProcessor interface for defining custom query processors
   - Multiple processor implementations provided
 - SPARQL 1.1 Update
  - New IUpdateableTripleStore interface
  - TripleStore class supports updates
  - Classes for representing different Update Commands
  - Parser for SPARQL Update
  - ISparqlUpdateProcessor for defining custom update processors
   - Multiple processor implementations provided
   - Apply full SPARQL Update on any Triple Store represented by an IGenericIOManager (full support dependent on features provided by IGenericIOManager)
  - New handler class for providing an endpoint supporting this protocol in your ASP.Net applications
 - SPARQL 1.1 Uniform HTTP Protocol for Graph Management
  - New SparqlHttpProtocolConnector for connecting to stores supporting this protocol
  - New handler class for providing an endpoint supporting this protocol in your ASP.Net applications
  - ISparqlHttpProtocolProcessor for defining custom protocol processors
   - Multiple processor implementations provided
- RDFa Support
 - RDFa 1.1 is supported
 - RdfAParser now supports selectable syntax compliance
- New Configuration System
 - New RDF based configuration system
 - Allows for the encoding of various objects as RDF and the loading of these Objects from the RDF Graph
 - Much simpler mechanism for configuring ASP.Net applications
- Pellet Server Client
 - Support for connecting to and using a Pellet Server knowledge base
- General Improvements
 - FileLoader and UriLoader can now raise warning events

Changed
- Bug Fixes
 - Turtle Tokeniser supports + at the start of plain numeric literals
 - Fixed faulty behaviour of == and != operators for Nodes when nulls are involved
 - Turtle and N3 parsers remove incorrect behaviour regarding unescaped " occurring at end of string
 - Turtle and N3 writers now always escape " character
 - UriLoader caching behaviour when using ETag based caching fixed
 - Some issues with persistence in the StoreGraph fixed
 - Disposing ISqlIOManager multiple times without PreserveState on no longer hangs the process
 - RDF/XML writers properly encode unescaped ampersands where necessary
 - Sorting involving literal nodes no longer fails if invalid values for known types are given
 - RDF/XML parser should now properly handle xml:base and provide better xml:base scoping support
- SPARQL
 - Now only Leviathan engine present in the library
 - Unified Tokeniser for SPARQL Query and Update
 - SparqlConnector improved 
  - Can be instantiated with pre-configured SparqlRemoteEndpoint instance
  - Properties for manipulating the underlying endpoint added
 - SparqlRemoteEndpoint improved
  - Default timeout increased to 30s instead of 15s
  - Support for HTTP Authentication and Proxy Servers
 - SPARQL Endpoints 
  - New handlers for providing Query, Update and Protocol services so all existing query handlers are now marked
    as obsolete
  - Support no-caching though this is not recommended
  - Supports absolute cache expiration
- General Improvements
 - Library now uses IAsyncResult pattern in many places as opposed to manual thread spawning
 - More writers made thread safe
 - Improved how compressing writers detect collections to significantly improve speed on blank node heavy graphs

Removed
 - Removed obsolete verison of QueryRaw() from SparqlRemoteEndpoint
 - Removed/obsoleted all methods and implementation pertaining to the Labyrinth SPARQL Engine
 - Removed defunct LocalName and Namespace properties from UriNode
