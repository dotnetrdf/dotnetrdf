Usage
-----

To use this library first unzip to a directory on your computer.  Then Add a Reference and use the Browse tab
to find the directory where you unzipped the archive and select dotNetRDF.dll
If you have downloaded the full source for the Project then you can add the Project to your Solution and then 
use Project references instead.

dotNetRDF includes intellisense for all classes providing that the dotNetRDF.XML file is located in the 
same directory as the DLL file.

To use classes from the library it is generally easiest to import the namespaces you need eg.

C#
using VDS.RDF;

VB
Imports VDS.RDF

Requirements
------------

To use this library you will need .Net Framework 3.5 SP1 and you may need to install/have available the 
following third party libraries:
- MySQL Connector.Net 6.0.3 which can be obtained from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/
- Virtuoso ADO.Net Provider which can be obtained from http://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/virtclientref.html
- JSON.Net 3.5r7 which can be obtained from http://www.codeplex.com/Json
- HtmlAgilityPack 1.4.0 Stable which can be obtained from http://www.codeplex.com/htmlagilitypack

The relevant DLLs (HtmlAgilityPack.dll, MySql.Data.dll, Newtonsoft.Json.dll and OpenLink.Data.Virtuoso.dll) are included with
this release and if you wish to use the library you may need to reference these DLLs as well to ensure it is available in your
project for dotNetRDF to use.
If you have downloaded the full source code for the Library you can add a Project Reference to your Solution
instead of referencing the DLL directly.  If you do this Visual Studio should automatically copy the 
relevant DLLs into your output directory if they are required.

Known Issues
------------

We are aware of the following issues with the library.  Please remember that this is an Beta release and so
there are things that may be buggy still and the API is subject to change at our discretion.
 
Query and Update

Thanks to the following people who have helped in the development process or whose suggestions have led to 
improvements in the code:
- Eamon Nerbonne for the BlockingStreamReader fix (http://eamon.nerbonne.org/) which is much nicer than the
  alternative of pre-caching in a MemoryStream
- Hugh Williams and Jacqui Hand of OpenLink Software (http://www.openlinksw.com) for helping me resolve some
  issues with their ADO.Net provider including promptly providing me with a fixed version once the issue
  I'd identified had been traced to it's cause and extending my evaluation license so I could build the code
- Toby Inkster (http://tobyinkster.co.uk/) for providing me with some TriX extensibility stylesheets that I 
  could use to test my TriX parser
- Marek Safar from the Mono project for fixing the bug in gmcs I identified which meant I couldn't compile
  a Mono build of dotNetRDF
- Andy Seaborne and Steve Harris for excellent answers to various SPARQL and ARQ function library related questions 
  which have contributed to resolving various issues in the Leviathan engine and adding the ARQ function library support
- Peter Kahle for his efforts in producing a Windows Phone 7 version of the library
- Paul Hermans for various suggestions related to the improvement of the Toolkit
- The SPARQL Working Group for useful feedback and responses to my comments

  plugging their stuff into the API
