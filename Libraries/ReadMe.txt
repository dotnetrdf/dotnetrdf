Security
--------

From 0.7.2 onwards most builds of dotNetRDF are once again strong named signed, if you need unsigned
builds for any reason please build yourself from source code.

The Silverlight, Windows Phone and Portable Class Library builds are not signed because assembly signing
has known limitations on those platforms due to lack of Assembly Redirects support on those platforms.
